Example Organization for you + wife + child

- Create an Organization called something like "Family"

- Invite wife to "Family" as an Owner (if you want her to have same read/write/create/delete access to all Collections and passwords as you. otherwise add as User and set her access for each Collection)
- Invite child to "Family" as a User
- Create 3 Collections
  -    "Shared Wife", add just wife (read/write) to this Collection
  -    "Shared Child", add wife (read/write) and child (read/write) or just child to this Collection
  -    "Shared All", add wife (read/write) and son (read-only) to this Collection

Whenever you create a new shared password, you can set the "Who owns this?" section to "Family" and check whichever Collection you want it to be available in depending on who you want to have access to the new password.

Add more Collections to organize groups of passwords for different people/uses if you want.
